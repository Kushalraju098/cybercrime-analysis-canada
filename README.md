Cybercrime Trends Analysis in Canada (2015–2024) using R and Power BI

📊 Cybercrime Trends in Canada (2015–2024)
🔍 Project Overview

This project analyzes cybercrime trends in Canada from 2015 to 2024 using national and provincial datasets.
The analysis focuses on:

long-term growth patterns,

major cybercrime categories,

regional distribution of incidents,

year-over-year change dynamics.

The project demonstrates data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling skills using R programming and Power BI.

🗂️ Datasets

National Cybercrime Totals (2015–2024)

Province-wise Cybercrime Incidents

Data was cleaned and transformed to a tidy format using pivot_longer().

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

R (tidyverse, ggplot2, scales)

Power BI (R Visual integration)

GitHub (version control & documentation)

📈 Key Visualizations

1. National Cybercrime Trend & YoY % Change

🔑 Key Insights

Cybercrime incidents have more than tripled since 2015.

Fraud is the dominant and fastest-growing cybercrime category.

Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta account for the majority of incidents.

A slight decline in 2024 may indicate stabilization or reporting changes.
