Cybercrime Trends Analysis in Canada (2015–2024) using R and Power BI

📊 Cybercrime Trends in Canada (2015–2024)
🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes cybercrime trends in Canada from 2015 to 2024 using national and provincial datasets.
The analysis focuses on:
   * long-term growth patterns,
   * major cybercrime categories,
   * regional distribution of incidents,
   * year-over-year change dynamics.
The project demonstrates data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling skills using R programming and Power BI.

🗂️ Datasets
National Cybercrime Totals (2015–2024) from Statistics Canada

Province-wise Cybercrime Incidents
Data was cleaned and transformed to a tidy format using pivot_longer().

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
1.R (tidyverse, ggplot2, scales)
2.Power BI (R Visual integration)
3.GitHub (version control & documentation)

📈 Key Visualizations

1. National Cybercrime Trend & YoY % Change
Shows both absolute incident counts and growth momentum.

2. Cybercrime Type Trends
Compares trends across major cybercrime categories such as Fraud and Extortion.

3. Provincial Distribution (2024)
Displays cybercrime incidents and percentage share by province.

(See /visuals folder for outputs)

🔑 Key Insights
* Cybercrime incidents have more than tripled since 2015.
* Fraud is the dominant and fastest-growing cybercrime category.
* Ontario, British Columbia, and Alberta account for the majority of incidents.
* A slight decline in 2024 may indicate stabilization or reporting changes.

🚀 Future Enhancements
    1.Per-capita analysis using population data
    2.Predictive modeling for cybercrime trends
    3.Interactive dashboards using Power BI
